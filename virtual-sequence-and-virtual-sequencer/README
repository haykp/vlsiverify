1. Example of without using Virtual Sequence and Sequncer.
2. Example of with Virtual Sequnce but without virtual sequencer
3. Example of with Virtual Sequnce and virtual sequencer (p_sequencer)
4. Example of with Virtual Sequnce and virtual sequencer (without p_sequencer)
      Attempt was made to use code without p_sequencer handle in virtual sequence.
      Instead of starting seq_A and seq_B using p_sequencer.
      Tried accessing v_seqr using env handle
